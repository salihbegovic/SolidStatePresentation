    abstract = "{We study a tensor hypercontraction decomposition of the Coulomb integrals of periodic systems where the integrals are factorized into a contraction of six matrices of which only two are distinct. We find that the Coulomb integrals can be well approximated in this form already with small matrices compared to the number of real space grid points. The cost of computing the matrices scales as O(N4) using a regularized form of the alternating least squares algorithm. The studied factorization of the Coulomb integrals can be exploited to reduce the scaling of the computational cost of expensive tensor contractions appearing in the amplitude equations of coupled cluster methods with respect to system size. We apply the developed methodologies to calculate the adsorption energy of a single water molecule on a hexagonal boron nitride monolayer in a plane wave basis set and periodic boundary conditions.}",

    abstract = "{A first-principles study of the adsorption of a single water molecule on a layer of graphitic carbon nitride is reported employing an embedding approach for many-electron correlation methods. To this end, a plane-wave based implementation to obtain intrinsic atomic orbitals and Wannier functions for arbitrary localization potentials is presented. In our embedding scheme, the localized occupied orbitals allow for a separate treatment of short-range and long-range correlation contributions to the adsorption energy by a fragmentation of the simulation cell. In combination with unoccupied natural orbitals, the coupled cluster ansatz with single, double, and perturbative triple particle–hole excitation operators is used to capture the correlation in local fragments centered around the adsorption process. For the long-range correlation, a seamless embedding into the random phase approximation yields rapidly convergent adsorption energies with respect to the local fragment size. Convergence of computed binding energies with respect to the virtual orbital basis set is achieved employing a number of recently developed techniques. Moreover, we discuss fragment size convergence for a range of approximate many-electron perturbation theories. The obtained benchmark results are compared to a number of density functional calculations.}",

Our implementation of EOM-CCSD theory is applied to study F-centers in alkaline earth oxides employing a periodic supercell approach. The convergence of the calculated electronic excitation energies for neutral color centers in MgO, CaO, and SrO crystals with respect to the orbital basis set and system size is explored. We discuss extrapolation techniques that approximate excitation energies in the complete basis set limit and reduce finite size errors. Our findings demonstrate that EOM-CCSD theory can predict optical absorption energies of F-centers in good agreement with experiment. Furthermore, we discuss calculated emission energies corresponding to the decay from triplet to singlet states responsible for the photoluminescence properties. Our findings are compared to experimental and theoretical results available in the literature.}",
